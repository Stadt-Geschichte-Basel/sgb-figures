## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository follows the [Advanced Structure for Data Analysis](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-advanced.html) of _The Turing Way_ and is organized as follows:

- `build/`: scripts and notebooks used to build the data
- `data/`: data files
- `docs/`: documentation for the data and the repository
- `output/`: generated PDF files
- `src/`: source code for the data (e.g., scripts used to collect or process the data)

## Data Description

This repository stores data and R code used by the [Team for Research Data Management and Public History](https://dokumentation.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/team.html) of the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel research project to create figures published in the [nine-volume book series](https://stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/baende).

One task of the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel RDM team is to provide visualisations for data used by the individual authors to support their arguments. Using raw data provided by the researchers, the RDM team created maps, diagrams and other types of visualisations for publication in the [print](https://www.merianverlag.ch/buecher/stadt.geschichte.basel.html) and [online (OA)](https://emono.unibas.ch/stadtgeschichtebasel) versions of Stadt.Geschichte.Basel.

To support open research with FAIR data, the RDM team developed a [research data platform](https://forschung.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch) to ensure open, long-term access to sources and research data regarding the history of Basel. The platform facilitates access to the data behind the publication, with metadata annotation following the [Manual for Creating Non-Discriminatory Metadata for Historical Sources and Research Data](https://maehr.github.io/diskriminierungsfreie-metadaten/) developed by Stadt.Geschichte.Basel.

### Plots

This GitHub repository provides the source code used to create the plots. In addition to the data already made available on the research data platform, the source code published here makes the figures even more customisable.

Following the steps below, users can build plots from the book series by themselves. The workflow produces the plots, as published, as `PDF` files in `CMYK` colour mode using the dimensions from the printed volumes. For technical reasons, plots and legends are written to separate PDF files. The plots are not shipped with the project's signature font family, but are generated with a generic system font due to copyright. Users can easily customise the plots' dimensions, colours, labels etc. by changing the parameters in the corresponding source code.

The (mostly numerical) data behind the plots, also available in interactive tables on the research data platform, is additionally stored in this repository in `csv` format. For each dataset, a `json` file is generated, providing metadata according to the [W3C standard for tabular data and metadata on the web](https://w3c.github.io/csvw/syntax/).

## Installation

Install Node.js, Quarto and R. Run the following commands in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
npm install
```

Set up the R environment using renv:

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Build

Print a list of all plots that can be built from this repository:

```bash
npm run list
```

Build an individual plot as PDF ‚Äì saving the plot to `output/` and the annotated data to `data/clean/`‚Äì by running the following command:

```bash
npm run plot
```

Specify the ID of the plot when prompted, e.g.:

```markdown
Bitte ID des Plots eingeben (z.B. 39017 f√ºr abb39017): 39017
```

You can also specify the plot directly:

```bash
npm run plot 39017
```

Build all plots from a specific volume, e.g. volume 7:

```bash
npm run vol 7
```

Build all plots that are available in this repository:

```bash
npm run all
```

## Support

This project is maintained by [@Stadt-Geschichte-Basel](https://github.com/stadt-geschichte-basel). Please understand that we can't provide individual support via email. We also believe that help is much more valuable when it's shared publicly, so more people can benefit from it.
